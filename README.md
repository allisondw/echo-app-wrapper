# 🪞 EchoAI — Zoom Meeting TL;DRs in One Command

_EchoAI is a privacy-friendly CLI tool that summarizes your Zoom meetings using GPT. No setup, no coding. Just run it and get your recap._

This repo contains the **launcher scripts** for EchoAI. The heavy lifting runs in Docker, so you don’t need to install Python or any dev tools.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Download the CLI script

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisondw/echoai/main/echoai -o /usr/local/bin/echoai
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/echoai
```

### 2. (One-time) Set up your OpenAI API key

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisondw/echoai/main/echoai-config.sh -o echoai-config.sh
chmod +x echoai-config.sh
./echoai-config.sh
```

This saves your key to `~/.echo-api-key` for future runs.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- 🐳 [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- 🧾 OpenAI API key ([get one](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
- 🗂️ Your Zoom transcripts saved in: `~/Documents/Zoom/`

EchoAI will find them automatically.

---

## 🧠 Usage

### ▶️ Show most recent meetings

```bash
echoai
```

Displays your 10 most recent meetings with:
- 📅 Timestamp
- 🧠 Inferred topic
- 🗣️ Top 3 speakers

Pick a number to summarize.

---

### 🔍 Search meetings by keyword

```bash
echoai Goose Q3 Bearman
```

Matches your search terms against:
- Meeting titles
- Speaker names
- Folder dates

Then shows the closest matches to pick from.

---

### 📝 Outputs

EchoAI will:
- Generate a **.summary.txt** file next to your transcript
- Cache a **.title.txt** file with inferred title + speakers
- Print everything to the terminal

---

## 🔐 Security

- Your API key is stored only in `~/.echo-api-key` (chmod 600)
- No data is saved inside the Docker container
- All transcript summarization happens locally, with API calls only to OpenAI

---

## 🐳 What’s inside the container?

EchoAI runs:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$HOME/Documents/Zoom:/zoom" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  ghcr.io/allisondw/echoai:latest \
  --zoom-dir /zoom [--list-recent 10 | --search ...]
```

…but you never have to type that. Just run:

```bash
echoai
```
